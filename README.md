# Redstone Tools

This is a small mod that adds some convenient tools for redstone builders.
It is available for Minecraft 1.17.1 Fabric.

## Commands :
#### Obtaining building blocks
* `/wool [color]`
  * Gives you a wool of the specified color.
  * For example, `/wool red` gives you a red wool.
  * `color` accepts abbreviations, `/wool w` gives you a white wool.
  * All abbreviations can be found in `WoolCommand.java`

It also supports other colored blocks.
* `/terra` for **terracotta**
* `/glass` for **stained glass**
* `/glaterra` for glazed **terracotta**
* `/conbl` for **concrete block**
* `/conpow` for **concrete powder**

#### Obtaining signal blocks
* `/bar [int]`
  * Gives you a barrel of specified signal strength.
  * For example, `/bar 8` gives you a barrel which can produce the signal strength of 8.
  * `int` varies from 0 to 15.

It also supports the **shulker box**.
* `/shulker [int]`
 
We usually use lecterns and books to control the signal strength.
* `/lectern`
 * Gives you a **lectern** which contains a **book with 15 pages**.
 * You can change the signal strength easily with the lectern.

#### Redstone
* `/binCount [bits] [signed] [distance] [direction]`
  * Calculate a binary number represented by redstone lamps.
  * `bits` [int] : The bits of the binary number. It can be at most 63.
  * `signed` [boolean] : The number is signed or unsigned. Using 2's complement if it is signed.
  * `distance` [int] : The distance between two redstone lamps.
  * `direction` : The direction of redstone lamps. It can a name, such as down, north, east, d, n, e. It can also be an axis, such as -y, -z, +x.
* `/hexCount [size] [signed] [distance] [direction]`
  * It is similiar to `binCount`, but it calculates a hexxadecimal number.
  * `size` is the digit of the number.

**You have to execute these 2 commands above the MSB block, so they can work properly.**

#### Other commands
* `/killitem`

Removee all item and xp orb entities.

* `/slab`

Gives you a slab.

You can also set the **keybindings** so that you can access these abilities without opening the menu everytime.

## Ingame Hud
Display some information on the screen. It can display coordinates, biomes, light level, hand held items and targetted blocks.

It also display extra information of the hand held item, such as enchantments, attribute modifiers and custom potion effects.
